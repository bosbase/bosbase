# Bosbase

**Bosbase** is a completely open-source backend platform designed as a modern alternative to PocketBase and Supabase. it delivers a full-featured backend solution while embracing the AI era with AI-driven development tools and flexible extensibility.

Bosbase is built on the foundation of PocketBase — huge thanks to the PocketBase project for the inspiration! We extended and redesigned it from first principles to better support large-scale commercial deployments, PostgreSQL as the primary database (with pgvector for vector capabilities), zero-downtime hot-reload for complex business logic, WASM plugins, and AI-assisted operations.
